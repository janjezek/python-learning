### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Name                     |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| `==`     | equal                    |
| `!=`     | not equal                |
| `>`      | greater than             |
| `>=`     | greater than or equal to |
| `<`      | less than                |
| `<=`     | less than or equal to    |

## Numbers

```python
int whole number (ex: 42)
float any number with a decimal (ex: 1.81)
```

### round

```python
round(var, 2) #round number to the defined number of decimals
```

### Arithmetic Operators

[Python Arithmetic Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_arithmetic_operators.asp)

| Operator | Name                                                                           | Example  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| +        | Addition: adds two operands                                                    | `x + y`  |
| â€“        | Subtraction: subtracts two operands                                            | `x â€“ y`  |
| \*       | Multiplication: multiplies two operands                                        | `x \* y` |
| /        | Division (float): divides the first operand by the second                      | `x / y`  |
| //       | Division (floor): divides the first operand by the second                      | `x // y` |
| %        | Modulus: returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second | `x % y`  |
| \*\*     | Power (Exponent): Returns first raised to power second                         | `x ** y` |

# while

```python
counter = 0
while counter < 10:
    print(counter)
    counter +=1
```

Don't forget, if your condition is a `>` then you might need to `-=`. This will subtract from the variable instead of adding to it.

```python
exit = ""
while exit != "yes":
    exit = input("Do you want to exit? ")
```

# while True Loop

After `break`, the computer jumps out of the loop to the next unindented line of code.

```python
while True:
    print("This program is running")
    goAgain = input("Go again?: ")
    if goAgain == "no":
        break

print("Aww, I was having a good time ðŸ˜­")
```

The `continue` command stops executing code in the loop and starts at the top of the loop again.

```python
while True:
    print("You are in a corridor, do you go left or right?")
    direction = input("> ")
    if direction == "left":
        print("You have fallen to your death")
        break
    elif direction == "right":
        continue
    else:
        print("Ahh! You're a genius, you've won")
```

The previous code continues to loop even after the user has won. Let's fix that with the `exit()` command.

## for Loop

```python
for counter in range(10):
    print(counter)
```

```python
for i in range(100, 110):
    print(i)
```

```python
for i in range (0, 1000000, 25):
    print(i)
```

## random library

```python
import random

myNumber = random.randint(1, 10)
print(myNumber)
```

I add the lowest number (1) and the highest number (100) that can be picked.

## Subroutines

```python
def my_function():
    print("Hello from a function")
```

```python
def my_function(fname, lname):
    print(fname + " " + lname)

my_function("Emil", "Refsnes")
```

```python
def my_function(x):
    return 5 * x

print(my_function(3))
```

## os Library

```python
import os
os.system("clear")
```

## time Library

`time.sleep(1)` function allows us to pause the program for the amount of seconds listed

## End, Sep

```python
for i in range(0, 100):
    print(i, end="\n") #new line
```

```python
def red(text):
    print("\033[0;31m", text, "\033[0m", end="", sep="")
```

## f function

```python
print("This is {}, using {} pronouns, and is {} years old.".format(name, pronouns, age))
```

```python
print("This is {name}, using {pronouns} pronouns, and is {age} years old. Hello, {name}. How are you? Have you been having a great {age} years so far".format(name=name, pronouns=pronouns, age=age))
```

### Short variation

```python
print(f"This is {name}, using {pronouns} pronouns, and is {age} years old. Hello, {name}.")
```

```python
answer = f"You thought Day {i} was {feeling}\n"
```

## Alignment

![Alignment](alignment.png)

```python
for i in range(1, 31):
    print(f"Day {i: <2} of 30")
```
